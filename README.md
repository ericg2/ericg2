# About Me

**Hello!** My name is Eric and I have been interested in programming and computers in general for quite a while. This page contains my new [GitHub](https://github.com/ericg2) account, however I have some [old](https://github.com/houseofkraft) [accounts](https://github.com/CoolMan119) that are not maintained anymore. Most of the important content has been transferred off them to eventually merge them into this one.

# Programming Languages
Here is a list of the Programming Languages that I am familiar with, learning, etc. These languages listed are most likely what will be shown on this GitHub page.

## **Java**
This is one of the programming languages I am most familiar with. I have created [RSA-AES](https://github.com/ericg2/RSA-AES), which was an attempt at making an dual encryption tool, as well as [NSP](https://github.com/ericg2/nsp), which was an easier Socket Protocol to make it easier for me to communicate between multiple devices including with Android.

## **C++ / Arduino**

I also have experience using and wiring the [Arduino](https://arduino.cc/) boards, and programming them in **C++**. I have created [MiniControl](https://github.com/ericg2/MiniControl), which was an attempt at making an "operating system" out of an Arduino. The physical aspect contained a double breadboard design, and featured a **Temperature Monitor**, **Rotary Dial**, **RGB Status LED**, **16x2 LCD Screen**, and an **Arduino Mega** due to the increased outputs and storage space.

Also, I have created designs that had limited but useful functions needed at the time. Such as a temperature monitor, motor controller, and others.

## **Python**
I have decent experience at Python, however it is not one of my strong languages. I mainly use this for making small tools, such as [pyautocorrect](https://github.com/houseofkraft/pyspellcorrect) which was used for spell correcting mistakes, before the spell checking got improved. I also made other small tools which were not always uploaded or useful.
